## Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must login to *your* Instagram account in order to properly access follower data. This is due to Instagram blocking `HTTPS GET` requests from unauthenticated sessions. This tool uses browser-based authentication only - you must be logged into Instagram in your browser.

> [!CAUTION]
> Instagram's Terms of Service restrict automated data collection. Use this tool responsibly and respect Instagram's policies. This tool is for educational purposes only.

> [!TIP]
> Always respect rate limits and pause between requests to avoid temporary restrictions.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> [Install Python 3.7+ if you don't have it already](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Install from this repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository (or download the ZIP file)
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-followers-exporter.git
$ cd instagram-followers-exporter

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - export followers for an account
$ python main.py -u instagram

# Specify a custom output filename
$ python main.py -u instagram -o custom_filename.json

# Force a new login session (useful if you're having auth issues)
$ python main.py -u instagram --force-login

# Adjust retry attempts for rate limiting
$ python main.py -u instagram --max-retries 5
```

## Output Format

The tool exports followers data to a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15 12:34:56.789012",
  "username": "instagram",
  "followers_count": 123,
  "followers": [
    {
      "username": "follower1",
      "full_name": "Follower One",
      "profile_pic_url": "https://...",
      "is_private": false,
      "is_verified": true
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Handling Rate Limits

Instagram strictly rate-limits API access. This tool implements several strategies to work within these limits:

1. Progressive delays between requests
2. Exponential backoff for retry attempts 
3. Session testing to detect authentication issues
4. Detailed error messages with guidance

If you encounter rate limiting issues:
- Wait at least 30 minutes before trying again
- Try using a different network connection
- Make sure you're properly logged into Instagram in your browser

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Login Problems
- If login fails, try using `--force-login` to clear cached sessions
- Make sure to complete all verification steps in the browser window
- For private accounts, you must be following the account to access their data

#### 401 Unauthorized Errors
- This usually indicates Instagram rate limiting
- Wait at least 30 minutes before trying again
- Consider using a different network connection

#### Incomplete Data
- For accounts with large follower counts, Instagram may not return complete data
- The script implements progressive delays to avoid triggering rate limits
- Try collecting data during off-peak hours
